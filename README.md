=====================

A plugin used to generate a list of clan members attending an event.

It is designed so any clan member can take attendance at an event and post attendance to their clan's social media.

It tracks the event duration and for every clan member, the time spent at the event and how late they joined the event.

At the end of the event, you can copy/paste the attendance list to your clan's social media, like Discord.

| NOTE: If your event takes place in multiple instances, you can have multiple members of your clan run the plugin and merge the resulting lists manually afterward |
